# small shell 
implementing a small shell as part of HW in operating systems course in the technion.

the small shell (smash) will behave like a real Linux shell but it will support only a limited subset of Linux shell commands.

there are basically two kinds of commands to be executed by smash:
built-in commands (chprompt,ls,showpid,pwd,cd,jobs,kill,fg,bg,...) and external commands (Pipes and IO redirection, timeout, ...).
